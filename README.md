5G Network Resilience Enhancement Project

Introduction
This repository contains the implementation of innovative algorithms designed to enhance the resilience of 5th generation (5G) networks, particularly during disaster scenarios. 5G networks mark a revolutionary step in connectivity, enabling rapid data transfers, low latency, and integration of diverse nodes, from smart vehicles to everyday objects. However, maintaining the resilience of these networks in adverse conditions remains a crucial challenge.

Thesis
Our approach proposes the use of Virtual Network Function (VNF) placement methods within cloud computing environments. This method not only considers edge clouds but also incorporates regional and core clouds, creating a multi-layered network structure for enhanced resilience. The aim is to optimize resource utilization and fortify network resilience by hosting 5G VNFs of the slices on these various cloud levels.

Algorithms
Two algorithms were developed and implemented:

Greedy Algorithm: Aims to reduce placement time and increase acceptance ratios, particularly post-disruptions like power outages.
Characteristic/Weight Calculation Algorithm: Tailored for diverse use cases, including Autonomous Vehicles, Remote Surgery, and Smart Grids.
